    -> The journey of learning binary exploitation started when my group members and I began our FYP in Vulnerability Research at the Linux kernel level in association with Ebryx.
    -> We wanted to choose a subsystem for our research-based project, for which our instructor at Ebryx guided us to first learn about the Linux kernel level. For this purpose, he told us to take a YouTube playlist of Binary Exploitation by LiveOverflow.
    -> In the very first video of this tutorial, he discussed some common commands that we use in Linux for different purposes.
    -> From the second video, the real game began!
    
    Some important points:
    -> ps aux | grep "firefox" This searches for the process 'firefox' in the list of running processes.
