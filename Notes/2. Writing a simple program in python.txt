-> After learning how to write c code in the terminal and some advanced features, now we will learn the same method to write python code as well. Following are some instructions regarding the required task:
-> To read command line arguments in python, we import a library 'sys'. We can access these parameters by using 'sys.argv'.
-> We can use ':!' in vim to execute any command in vim rather than opening a separate terminal. e.g. ':! python file_name.py' will execute the python script.
-> If you do not want to add the keyword 'python' while running the python command, we can use shebang command at the start of the python script. e.g. '#!/usr/bin/python2.7'
-> Now we can run the code with the command './file_name'.
-> If we get denied permissions error, check the file permissions by running the command: 'ls -la file_name'. It will show something like '-rwxrwxr-x .....'
-> If it does not contain 'x', it means that it is not executable. x means executable, w means write and r means read.
-> The execution permissions can be edited using the chmod command. e.g. 'chmod +x file_name.py'.
-> If you write './' and press the tab button twice, the terminal will display all the possible files that could be followed.
